A Heap is a complete binary tree data strucutre that satisfies the heap property
for every node, the vcalue of its childern is less than or equal to its own value
Heaps are usaully used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest)
element is always at the root of the tree

Operations of Heap:

Insert: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining heap properties
Extract-Max/Extract-Min: Removes the root element and restrucure the heap
Increase/Decrease-Key: Updates the value of a node and restructure the heap

Types of Heap:

Max-Heap: Root node has the maximum 
Min-Heap: Root node has the minimum value among its childern

Applications of Heap:

Priority Queues
Sorting
Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
