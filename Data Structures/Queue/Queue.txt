A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science 
used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It
follows the principle of "First in, First Out" (FIFO), where the first
element added to the queue is the first one to be removed

Operations on Queue:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue
Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue
Peek: Retrieves the front element without removing it
isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty
isFull: Checks if the queue is full

Types of Queues:

Circular Queue: Last elements connects to the first element 
Double-Ended Queue(Deque): Operations can be performed from both ends
Priority Queue: Elements are arranged based on priority
