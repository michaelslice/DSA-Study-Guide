Hashing is a technique that generates a fixed-size output (hash value) from
an input of variable size using mathematical formulas called hash functions.
Hashing is used to determine an index or location for storing an item in a data 
structure, allowing for efficient retrieval and insertion.

Key Concepts:

Hash Functin: A matheatical function that maps an input to a hash value
Hash Table: A data structure that stores key-value pairs, where the key
is a hash value and the actual value is the actual data
Collision: When two different keys produce the same hash value

Types of Hash Functions:

Division Method: Divides the input by a constant and uses the remainder as 
the hash value
Mid Square Method: Squares the input and takes the middle digits as the hash value
Folding Method: Divides the input into equal sized blocks and adds them together to get 
the hash value
Multipication Method: Multiplies the input by a constant and takes the fractional part as the hash value
