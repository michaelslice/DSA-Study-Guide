Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of 
elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contigous memory,
allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.

Operations on Array:

Traversal: Iterating throught the elements of an array
Insertion: Adding an element to the aray at a specific index
Deletion: Removing an element from the array at a specific index.
Searching: Findign an element in the array by its value or index.

Types of Arrays:

One-Dimensional Array: A simple array with a single dimension
Multidimensional-Array: An array with multiple dimensions, such as a matrix.

Applications of Array:

Storing data in a sequential manner
Implementing queues, stacks
Representing matrices and tables
