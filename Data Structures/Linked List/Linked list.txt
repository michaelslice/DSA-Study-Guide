A linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes,
which are connected by pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists are stored 
in contigous memory locations

Characteristics of Linked List:

Dynamic: Liked lists can be easily resized by adding or removing nodes
Non-contiguous: Nodes are stored in random memory locations and connected by pointers
Sequential access: Nodes can only be accessed sequentially, starting from the head of the list

Operations on Linked List:

Creation: Creating a new linked list or adding a new node to an existing list
Traversal: Iterating through the list and accessing each node.
Insertion: Adding a new node ata specific position in the list
Deletion: Removing a node from the list
Search: Finding a node with a specific value in the list

Types of Linked List:

Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the list
Doubly Linked List: Eaach node points to both the next and previous nodes in the list
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular loop
