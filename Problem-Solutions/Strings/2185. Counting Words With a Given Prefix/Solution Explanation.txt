Goal: Count how many words in a vector string have the string prefix

Explanation:

1. First create a count variable to store the quantity of times a prefix appears in the vector string

2. Secondly create a for each loop to iterate through the vector string

3. In the for loop create a nested if statement with the condition where from the element in the vectors substr from index 0 to the prefixs length is equal to the prefix, increment count


    for (const std::string& letter: words)
    {
        if(letter.substr(0, pref.length()) == pref)
        {
            ++count;
        }
    }

4. Finally return count
