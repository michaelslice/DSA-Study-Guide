Goal: Iterate through a string and count how many times you can spell the word balloon

Explanation:

1. First create variables to store the count of each letter for balloon, you only need 1 variable for l and 0

2. Secondly create a for loop to iterate through each element in the string text

3. In the for loop create a nested if-statement, and else-if chain, and if the element is == to the letters in balloon, increment the variables

4. Create a variable named min_occurance to calculate the occurance of how many time balloon can be spelled by creating a initializer list

5. Finally return min_occurance variable
