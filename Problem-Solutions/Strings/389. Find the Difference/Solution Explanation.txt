Goal: You have two strings s, and t. t is generated by random shuffling string s. Return the letter that was added to t

Explanation:

1. First create a variable named n that stores the length of string s

2. Secondly sort string s, and string t

3. Next create a for loop to iterate through each element in the string t

4. In the for loop create a nested if statement with a condition where if s[i] is not equal to t[i] return the index of t[i] that is not in s

5. Lastly return the last element in t which will be added element

return t[n];
