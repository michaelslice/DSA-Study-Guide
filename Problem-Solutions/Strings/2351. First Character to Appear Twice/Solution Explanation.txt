Goal: Return the first letter that appears twice in a string 

Explanation:

1. First create a integer variable to store the minimum value

2. Create a for loop to iterate through the size of the string, use i as increment variable

3. Next create a nested for loop to iterate through the size of the string, use j as the increment variable

4. In the for loop create a nested if statement that comapares the index [i] to index [j] 

5. Next use the mini variable to check the min value amongst mini and the index [j], which is the index of the duplicate value

if(s[i] == s[j])
{
  mini=min(mini, j);
}

6. Finally return the string s, with the index of mini

return s[mini];
