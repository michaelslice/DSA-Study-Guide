1. Sort the nums array to prevent using duplicate elements

2. Create a for loop iterating over the size of the vector, and check if `nums[i] == nums[i - 1]`, if there are duplicates `continue` 

3. Use the Two Pointers technique, and initialize a left pointer starting after the fixed element, and a right pointer starting at the end of the vector

4. While left pointer is less than right pointer, keep calculating threeSum, `threeSum = num + nums[left] + nums[right]`

5. If threeSum == 0, `ans.push_back({num, nums[left], nums[right]});
