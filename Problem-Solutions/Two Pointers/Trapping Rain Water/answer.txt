1. Use the Two Pointers technique and initialize a left and right pointer

2. While the left pointer is less than the right pointer, calculate the max_height seen for the left and right pointer

3. Calculate the amount of rain water trapped by subtracting the current height by the max height for each side

4. Add the amount of water trapped for the left and right side to a ans variable

5. If the value at `nums[left] < nums[right]` increment left, else decrement right

6. Return ans
