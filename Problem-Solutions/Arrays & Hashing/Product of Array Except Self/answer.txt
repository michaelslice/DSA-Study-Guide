1. Create a vector named ans to store the answers

2. Iterate through nums, and insert those elements into ans

3. Initialize a variable prefix to 1, and then 
iterate through nums from LEFT to RIGHT, updating ans[i] with the current prefix

4. Update the prefix value by multiplying it by the current element in nums[i]

5. Initialize a variable postfix to 1, and then create a second for loop iterating 
backwards through nums from RIGHT to LEFT,

6. Update the current index in ans by multiplying it by postfix

7. Update postfix by multiplying it by the current element in nums
