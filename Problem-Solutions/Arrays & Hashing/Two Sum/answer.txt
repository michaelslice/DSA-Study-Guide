1. Create a hashmap, key(complement), value(index)

2. Iterate through the vector, and find the complement = target - nums[i]

3. Find the complement in the map, until reaching the end of the map, and return 

4. return {map[complement], i}
    map[complement]: The index of the complement stored in the map
    i: The index of the other current element

5. If the complement is not found update the map with the current element as the key, and the index as its value
    map[nums[i]] = i;
