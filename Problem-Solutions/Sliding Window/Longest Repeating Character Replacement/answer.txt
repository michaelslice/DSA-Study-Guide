1. Use the Sliding Window technique and a hashmap to track the count of the current elements

2. Iterate through s[i] with the right pointer

3. Keep inserting values into the hashmap, along with incrementing their count

4. Calculate the most common element in the map

5. Calculate the current window length `right - left + 1`

6. If the least frequent element exceeds k, decrement the count of that element by the left pointer in the map,
   and shrink the window, by incrementing left

7. Update the current max_substring, and return it
