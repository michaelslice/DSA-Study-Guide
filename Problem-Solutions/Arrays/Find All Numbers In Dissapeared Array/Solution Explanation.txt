Goal: Find the missing element in the array from 1 to n

Explanation:

1. First initialize a variable that returns the size of nums

2. Next initialize a vector that begins at zero, and increments by 1 

3. Next initialize a vector so when we find a element that is misisng we can push it back 

4. Count the occurance of each element in the vector 

    for(auto num: nums)
    {
        freq[num]++; // count the occurrence of each element in the array
    }

5. Iterate through each element of the array and if the number at index i is not in freq vector it returns 0. Meaning it is missing from the nums vector

(!freq[i]) // if i is not in freq
