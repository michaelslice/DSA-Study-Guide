Goal: Find the most frequent element in a vector.

Explanation:

1. First make a hashmap with int keys and values

2. Iterate through the vector and use the hashmap to keep count of each occurance

Example: 

hashmap[num]++;

3. Initialize a variable most_frequent_element, and max_frequency to 0, so we can keep track of each occurance in the vector.

4. Next make a for each loop to iterate through the hashmap.

5. After add a conditional if-statement to keep iterating if the value of the element is greater than the previous one. 

6. Initialize the most_frequent_element to the key, and initialize max_frequency to the value

7. Finally return the variable most_frequent_element
