Goal: Find the integer in a array that is repeated twice.

Explanation:

1. First create a hashmap, and secondly create a vector

2. Secondly create a for loop that iterates through the nums array, use the hashmap to increment the count of each value in nums

    for(const auto& num: nums)
    {
        hashmap[num]++;
    }

3. Create a for loop that iterates through each element of the hashmap, if the key value is greater than 1 push back the value to the vector

   for(const auto& ans: hashmap)
    {
        if(ans.second > 1)
        {
            vec.push_back(ans.first);
        }
    }

4. Finally return the front of the vector, which will represent the repeated element
