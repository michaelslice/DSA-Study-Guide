Goal: Find the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.

Explanation:

1. First use std::min_element, and std::max_element to find the min and max element in the vector.

2. Secondly create a variable to store the size of the vector.

3. Use a for loop to iterate through the total of the vector.

4. In the inside of the for loop iterate through the salary vector, and add each element to the sum variable, which calculates the total sum of the vector.

5. Next subtract the minimum and maximum values from the sum variable

6. Lastly return the average of the salaries and subtract them by 2, to account for the min and max value being removed.
