Goal: Find the two numbers indices that add up to the target.

Explanation:

1. First create a hashmap

2. Secondly create a for loop to iterate through the nums array

3. Next create a equation that iterates through the array until the two target nums are found

int ans = target - nums[i]

4. Next add a conditional where if the hashmap cant find the target nums the loop exits

5. If the two nums are found return the ans number and static cast it to a index

6. Finally return the hashmaps index of the array in i and static cast it 

hashmap[num[i]] = static_cast<int> i
