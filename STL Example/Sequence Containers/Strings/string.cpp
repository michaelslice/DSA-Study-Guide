 *  size: Returns the number of characters in the string.
 *  length: Returns the number of characters in the string (equivalent to size()).
 *  substr: Returns a substring of the string. Takes the starting position and length as arguments.
 *  find: Searches for a substring within the string and returns the position of the first occurrence. If not found, it returns `std::string::npos`.
 *  compare: Compares two strings lexicographically. Returns 0 if equal, a negative value if less, and a positive value if greater.
 *  append: Adds characters to the end of the string.
 *  insert: Inserts characters into the string at a specified position.
 *  erase: Removes characters from the string. Takes the starting position and length as arguments.
 *  empty: Checks whether the string is empty. Returns true if empty, false otherwise.
 *  replace: Replaces a portion of the string with another string. Takes the starting position, length, and replacement string as arguments.
 *  c_str: Returns a C-style null-terminated character array equivalent to the string.
