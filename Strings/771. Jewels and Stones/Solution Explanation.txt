Goal: You have a string of jewels, and you must find how many jewels are in your string of stones

Explanation:

1. First create a count variable, to count how many times a jewel appears in the stones

2. Next create a for loop to iterate through the jewels length

3. Next create a nested for loop to iterate through the stones length

4. Next create a nested if statement to compare the index of the jewels string to the index of the stones strings

6. Finally if the values are equal increment the count variable, meaning a jewel is in the stones

7. Return the count variable, which represents how many times a jewel is in the stones
