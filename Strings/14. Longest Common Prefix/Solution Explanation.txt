Goal: Find the longest common prefix amongst a vector of strings

Explanation:

1. First create a string variable to store the prefix 

2. Secondly initialize result to index 0

result = strs[0]

3. Create a for loop to to iterate through the strs vector, initialize i to 1.

4. In the for loop create a nested for loop to iterate through the result variable

5. In the for loop create a nested if statement and that checks if the character in strs at index [i] and [j] is not equal to result at at index [j] the code will run. Basically if the elements are not the same the code will run

6. If the condition is true update the result variable with the characters from index 0 to index j. This is done to ensure the substr is only characters amongst all the words
