Goal: Return the number of different transofrmations among all words with morse code

Explanation:

1. First create a vector to store all the morse codes

2. Secondly create a hashmap and define the string as the values and ints as the key identifier

3. Next create a for loop to iterate through the size of the words vector

4. In the for loop create a nested for loop that uses [i] to iterate through the words vector

5. In the for loop define a variable to named str and use += to append the morse code representation for the current string, the 'a' is an offset for getting the letter

6. After doing so use the hashmap and assign the str to 1, meaning the key value is a integer value

7. Finally return the hashmap size, which will represent the unique number of representations possible
