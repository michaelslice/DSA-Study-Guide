Goal: Given two strings return true if two arrays reoresent the same string and false otherwise 

Explanation:

1. First create a string variable named check which stores "", and create a second string variable which stores ""

2. Secondly create a for loop to iterate through the size of string1

3. In the for loop add check and the index of word1 to check

    check = check + word1[i];

4. Next create another for loop to iterate through the size of word2

5. In the for loop add the confirm varaible to the index of word2

 confirm = confirm + word2[j];

6. Finally return check and confirm == 

return check == confirm;
