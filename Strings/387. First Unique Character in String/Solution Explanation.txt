Goal: Find the first non-repeating character in a string and return its index

Solution:

1. First create a hashmap with a char as the values, and a int as the key

2. Secondly create a for loop to iterate throug the size of the string

3. In the for loop count the occurance of each element in the string 

hashmap[s[i]]++;

4. After create a for loop to iterate through the size of the string

5. Next create a nested if statement that checks if the hashmap count of the strings index is equal to 1 

6. If the count is equal to 1 return i, and if the count doesnt appear twice return -1
