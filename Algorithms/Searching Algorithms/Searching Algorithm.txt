Searching algorithms are used to locate specific data within a larger
set of data. It helps find the presence of a target value within the data.
There are various types of searching algorithms, each with its own approach and 
efficiency.

Most Common Searching Algortihms:

Linear Search: Iterative search from one end to the other
Binary Search: Divide-and-conquer search on a sorted array,
halving the search space at each iteration.
Ternary Search: Divide-and-conquer search on a sorted array, divide the search
space into three parts at each iteration.
