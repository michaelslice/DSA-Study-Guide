As the name sugests, this algorithm builds up the solution one piece 
at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit
which is the most optimal choice at that moment. So the problems 
where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global solutions are
best fit for greedy.

Most Important Greedy Algortihms

Fractional Knapsack: Find the maximum total value of items
that can be placed in the knapsack, allowing fractional inclusion of items
Dijkstra's Algortihm: Find the shortest path from a source vertex to all 
other vertices in a weighed graph.
Kruskal's Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a weighed graph
Huffman Coding: Creates an optimal prefix code for a set of symbols 
minimizing the total encoding length
