Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls iteself within 
its own definition. It is usually used to solve problems that can be broken
down into smaller instances of the same problem. For example Towers of Hanoi
Factorial Calculation, Fibonacci Sequence.

Steps:

Base Case: Define a condition that stops the recursive calls and provides
a solution.
Recursive Case: Define the steps to break down the problem into smaller instances 
and make recursive calls
Return: Return the solution from the recursive calls and combine them 
to solve the original problem

Recursion forms the base for many other algorithms, Tree Traversals,
Graph traversal, Divide and Conquer Algortihms, Backtracking Algorithms,
