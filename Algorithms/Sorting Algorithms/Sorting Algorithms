Sorting Algorithm:

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange the elements of a list in a specific order
such as numerical or alphabetical. It organizes the items in a systematic way, making it easier to search for and access specific elements.

Most Used Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Iteratively compares adjacent elemets and swaps them if 
they are out of order. The largest element "bubbles" to the end of the list with each pass.

Selection Sort: Finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element. Repeats this process until the entire list is sorted.

Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each unsorted element into its correct position in the sorted portion.

Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the list into two sublists based on the pivot,
and recursively applies the same process to the sublists.

Merge Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together to obtain the sorted list.
