Divide and Conquer Algortihms follow a recursive strategy to solve
problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems, solving those 
subproblems, and combining the solutions to obtain the final solution.

Steps:

1. Divide: Partition the problem into smaller, independent subproblems
2. Conquer: Recursively solve each subproblem
3. Combine: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to obtain the final solution

Examples:

Merge Sort: Divides the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively
and merges the sorted halves
Quick Sort: Selects a pivot element, partitions the array into two subarrays 
based on the pivot, and recursively sorts each subarray
Binary Search: Divides the search space in half repeatedly until the
target element is found or the search space is exhausted
