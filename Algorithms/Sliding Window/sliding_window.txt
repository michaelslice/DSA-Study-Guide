Sliding Window: Is a technique in which a fixed or variable-size window is a moved through a 
data structure, typically an array or string, to solve problems efficiently based on continuous subsets
of elements. 

Types of Sliding Window:

1. Fixed Size Sliding Window:
    The window has a fixed size, and it moves from the start to the end 
    of the array or string.

2. Variable Size Sliding Window:
    The window size can grow or shrink depending on the problems conditions
