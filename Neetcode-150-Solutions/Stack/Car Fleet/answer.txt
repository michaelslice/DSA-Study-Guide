Goal: We need to find the number of fleets, the problem involves cars 
traveling on a single lane road, a fleet is a group of cars that travel 
together. Meaning a faster car that catches up to a slower car will form
a fleet, and they will reach their destination together.

1. First sort the cars position in descending order

2. For each car calculate how long it will take to reach the target

3. Track the time of the last fleet

4. If the current cars time is greater than the previous fleets time than it forms a new fleet
