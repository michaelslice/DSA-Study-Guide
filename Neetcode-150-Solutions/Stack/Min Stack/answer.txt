Intution/Goal: We neet to implement functions that that will work on a stack

1. Create a stack data structure, and for the data type make it Node, in minStack implement a Node structure
   that will have a min, and val value with it

2. When pushing elements onto the stack keep calculating the min with the val and the current min

3. All other functions just use the built in STL function on the stack
