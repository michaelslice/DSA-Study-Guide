Goal: We need to iterate throught the vector of strings and calculate the reverse polish notation

1. Iterate throught the vector if the current element is not a operand push it on to the stack

2. Get the left and right elements from the stack and pop them

3. If the current element in the stack is equal to the operand, perform that operation with the left and
   right elements and push onto stack

4. Return the top of the stack
