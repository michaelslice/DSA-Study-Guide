1. Intiailize a unordered set with the elements in nums

2. Iterate through the set, and check if the num is the start of a sequence if `num - 1` is not in the set

3. Intialize `length = 1` and then iterate through the set and while the `num + length` is in the set increment count

4. Outside of the if statement intialize count with the max of length and count

5. Return count
