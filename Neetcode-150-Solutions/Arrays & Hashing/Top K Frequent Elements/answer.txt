1. Iterate through nums, and update the hash map with values and their count

2. Create a vector<pair<int, int>> pair_vec, to store the number and its count

3. Sort the vector<pair<int, int>> pair_vec by elements with the highest count

4. Iterate through the pair_vec until k, and push_back the num.first to the vector

5. Return vector ans
