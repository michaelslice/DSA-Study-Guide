Goal: Create a time based key value data structure

1. Create a unordered map with the key being a string, and the value being a vector of pairs
of int and string

2. For the set method for the current key push_back the timestamp and the value

3. For the get method check if the key is equal to the end if so return ""

4. Otherwise do binary search on our unordered map, by checking for m[key][mid]

5. If high is greater than or equal to 0 return m[key][high].second
