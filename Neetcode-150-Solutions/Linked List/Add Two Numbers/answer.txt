Goal: Digits are stored in reverse order in a linked list, add the two numbers
and return the result as a linked list

Time Complexity: O(max(m, n))
Space Complexity: O(max(m, n))

1. Create a dummy list, and a pointer to track the current node, and carry num

2. Iterate until either list is not empty

3. Calculate the nums value by checking if the list is null and either assign the value or 0

4. Add together the values of both lists and the carry

5. Calculate carry by dividing the sum by 0

6. Append the value of the sum modulo 10 to the next poiner of current

7. Check if l1 or l2 is null, and move to the next element

8. Check if the carry is equal to 1 if so append 1 to the curr pointer

9. Return dummy->next
