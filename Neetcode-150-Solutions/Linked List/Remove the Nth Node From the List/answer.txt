Goal: Remove the nth node from the list

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

1. Use the two pointers technique, check if the head node is NULL, if so return NULL

2. Create a slow and fast pointer, and move the fast pointer n steps ahead

3. Check for if n is the size of the list, if fast becomes NULL then return the next pointer

4. Move slow and fast across the list, until fast has reached the end of the list

5. Remove the nth node by updating slow to skip the nth element

6. Return the modified list
