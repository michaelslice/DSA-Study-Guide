Goal: Construct a deep copy of the nodes of the list, and store the mapping from original
nodes to new nodes in an unordered map

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

1. Create a map with the key being being a pointer to the original node, and the value being a pointer to the copied node

2. Create a temp pointer to the head of the list

3. Create a deep copy of all nodes, and update the head of the list

4. Reset the head pointer

5.
