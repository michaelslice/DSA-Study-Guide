Goal: Iterate through two lists and append append them to a new list in sorted order

1. Check if both lists are empty, if list1 is empty, and if list2 is empty

2. Create a dummy list node, to track and store the new sorted list

3. Iterate through both lists as long as they are both not equal to NULL

4. Check if the value in list1 is less than or equal to the value in list2
   if so append the node to the next pointer in the list

5. Keep moving the current node to the next node in the list

6. Finally check if there are remaining nodes in either list, if so append the opposite 
   nodes from the empty list

7. Return the dummy next pointer, because the original dummy node was a placeholder
