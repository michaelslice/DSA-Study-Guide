Goal/Intution: We need to calculate the amount of days for a higher temperature

1. Use a stack to store current index of first element

2. Iterate through the temperatures vector

3. While the stack is not empty, and the current temperature is greater than 
the element at current stack index, calculate the number of days and pop the stack

4. Outside of the loop push the new index onto the stack

5. Return the vector ans
