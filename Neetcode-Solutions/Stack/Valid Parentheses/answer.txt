Intutution/Goal: We need to see if a string has a valid number of parentheses, we can solve this by pushing
opening brackets onto the stack, and seeing if a string element is equal to a closing bracket

1. Iterate through the string

2. If you find a opening bracket push it onto the stack, if not return false

3. Check if the current element is equal to a closing bracket and if see if there is a match
   if so pop the stack a valid match was found

4. If not match was found return false it was not valid
