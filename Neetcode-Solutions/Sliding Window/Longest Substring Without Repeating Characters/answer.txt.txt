1. Use the Sliding Window technique, to find the valid subarray, also use a set to maintain a unique amount of elements

2. Iterate through `s` using the right pointer

3. If duplicate is found s[right], enter a while loop and keep removing s[left] from the set until the duplicate is removed
   and keep incrementing left pointer

4. Outside keep calculating the max substring without duplicates, and add s[right] to the set

5. Return max_substring
