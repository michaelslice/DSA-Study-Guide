Goal: Search the vector to find the target elements index in O(log n)

1. Use two pointers and iterate through nums while left is less than or equal to right

2. Keep calculating the mid index which is left(left - right) / 2

3. If nums[mid] equal target return mid

4. If mid is less than target, recalculate left mid + 1

5. Else right = mid - 1
