Goal: We need to find the minimum eating speed for 
      Koko to eat all the bananas in h hours
    
1. Calculate the largest pile of bananas

2. Initialize a left and right pointer, each starting at opposite sides of the vector

3. While left pointer less than or equal to right pointer, keep calculating the mid pointer

4. For the current index calculate the hours it would koko to eat all the bananas, this can
be done using the ceil functin `ceil((double) piles[i] / k)

5. If the hours taking to eat is less than or equal to h, then it is valid, update the answer
with `result = min(result, k)`, also reduce the upper bound search

6. If the hours taking to eat is not valid, increase the lower bound search

7. Return the result
