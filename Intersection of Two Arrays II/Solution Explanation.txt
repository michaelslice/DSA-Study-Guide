Goal: Find the pairs of integers between two vectors

Explanation:

1. Create a vector to store the elements that are in both vectors

2. Create a for loop to iterate through the first array, add a nested for loop to iterate through the second array

3. Add a if conditional statement to compare the index between array

if(nums1[i] == nums2[j]

4. If the elements are the same push it back to the vec

5. In the index of nums2 at index [j] -1 to mark it as visited

6. Add a break statement meaning all matches have been found

7. Return the vec
