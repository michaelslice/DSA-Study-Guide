Goal: Find the range of values that can be obtained by adding or subtracting 'k' from each element of the array and then returning the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values within this range.

Explanation:

1. First we initialize two variables to represent index[0] of the vector nums.

2. Secondly create a loop to iterate through each element of the vector.

3. In the loop use std::min, and std::max to caluclate the mini and max between index[0] and the current index 0f nums[i] as the loop is iterating.

4. After define a result variable, and use the std::max function to subtract 'k' from the max value, and add 'k' to the min value, you will need to add a zero as well so the answer is not zero.

Example:

 int result = max(0, (maxi - k) - (mini + k));

 return result;
