Goal: Find the index of the target element in a sorted Array

Explanation:

1. First use std::sort to sort the array in sequential order

2. Create a vector to hold the target elements

3. Create a for loop to iterate through each element in the array

4. In the for loop if the element is equal to the target push back the index to the vector

5. Return the vec, which holds the index values where the target is
